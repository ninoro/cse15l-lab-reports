I do not know why my code is not running and am having trouble with debugging the ListExamples.java file. I think that the while loop condition in the merge method might be contributing to the out-of-bounds error. The loop is defined as while index < length, but I have a feeling it should be adjusted to while index < length - 1.

# TA Response

Hello! I took a look at the code snippet you have shared and it does seem likely that the while loop condition in the merge method is causing the `IndexOutOfBoundsException`. Since ArrayList indices are zero-based, attempting to access index 1 is causing the `IndexOutOfBoundsException`. Adjusting the loop condition to using a '<=' should indeed prevent accessing an index that's out of bounds.

# After Fix

Changing the operators of the while loops to “<” instead of “<=” helped duebug my code and my test cases passed successfully. The index would try to access index1, which was higher than the length of the list, and this would put it out of bounds.
