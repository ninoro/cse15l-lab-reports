- Using Command `cat`
  1) No arguments
     <br> _Working Directory_: home <br>
     The `cat` command prints out the contents of the file. Since there is no argument, the `cat` command will display the content of the standard input (stdin). This means it will wait to input text manually.
     <br> _Error_: No Errors <br>
